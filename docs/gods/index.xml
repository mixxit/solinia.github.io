&lt;div class=&#34;pageinfo pageinfo-primary&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuzulus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuzulus is the God of Hate and Jealousy and is the son of Ingorir and Lunarine. He is most known for his lust and eventual murder of Zephyr in cold blood said to spite Ashoka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuzulus gave access to the Plane of Wind to the Oshira which allowed the destruction of Zephyr and his elevation to God of Wind after her destruction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;caerthian-origins&#34;&gt;Caerthian Origins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed Lunarine saw something terrible unfolding on Solinia during the Age of Defiance. Deciding to intervene she
approached a priest of the sun known as Ingorir. Believing it to be a messenger of Sol&amp;rsquo;Azul, Ingorir fell to his knees in awe. Lunarine caressed his cheek and smiled..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;You have a temper that others cannot see, I will see that fire stoked. Do for me just one task and I will offer you a place in permanent servitude to the blazing fires of the sun&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaring in pure admiration at the bright glow of the Goddess he quivered &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;hellip; anything&amp;hellip;!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kissed his forehead and beckoned him forward, &amp;lsquo;Come - show your love to the Goddess. Our embrace shall bring forth a new order, one that will last for a hundred thousand years&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confused priest held her hand and walked onwards into the light. &amp;lsquo;When you awake, you shall be with a gift of our union. You must ensure the Queen takes one bite. With this action you will change everything. In 20 years a journey will open towards the North, you must take it and then everything will be clear&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goddess wrapped her arms around the priest as light shone throughout the Temple of Sol&amp;rsquo;Azul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;Then shall we be together once more&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright light subsided and the priest looked upwards, lifting himself up from the floor of the temple he noticed the dragon fruit in his hand. Clasping it shut he headed straight for the palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not long after that the queen gave birth to Deuzulus Val&amp;rsquo;Elsir, Prince and heir to the Caerthians Throne. In his youth he became fascinated with the forbidden Aerindal. How different and beautiful he thought they were, he became enamored by Princess Zephyr Vaelan, finding any way he could to get a glimpse of her beyond the northern walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was when he reached the age of 20 that a delegation of the Valderain, Keladun and Aerindal came before the Caerthians. They hoped to travel on a pilgrimage north, to the last refuge of the Dal, and ask why the earth seemed to be tearing itself apart. Seeing Zephyr was a member of the pilgrimage, Deuzulus demanded his inclusion, the Emperor was reluctant however, understanding his tutor Ingorir would be in the party, evenutally agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long journey, frought with dangers, but the delegation finally arrived. The last remaining Dal spoke before the pilgrims and explained all she could about place they stood. The Anchor, was a place that held the past, present and future together. She spoke of an event that was happening, far in the future, that stood to tear everything apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elemental pantheon was waning, they no longer had the worshippers or energy to maintain order in the universe. It was time for a new elemental pantheon to emerge, one that could bring a new order to the world. She spoke of how the Kelderan and Dal had replaced the Prime Elemental Pantheon in the centuries earlier, and now it was time for the new races to take the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With agreement, they stepped forward into the anchor, and a new Pantheon emerged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gias of the Keladun - The Goddess of Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingorir of the Caerthians - The God of Fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manandu of the Valderain - The Goddess of Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr of the Aerindal - The Goddess of Wind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching as Zephyr vanished into the blackness of the anchor, Deuzulus screamed out &amp;lsquo;Zephyr, no! Don&amp;rsquo;t leave me!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Dal held her hands out to the sun elf, &amp;lsquo;I am sorry child, she is no longer the one you once loved&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;She has transcended to something far greater, she will never know life as the mortals do. She has a great duty now and so have you&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elf looked, confusingly at the Dal, &amp;lsquo;What about me?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Everything must be balanced&amp;rsquo;, she smiled &amp;lsquo;And the partner of Order is Chaos&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docs: Enruel</title><link>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/gods/enruel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/gods/enruel/</guid><description>

&lt;/div&gt;
Zhuvirae is the Goddess of the Moon and Matron of Shadow It is believed her influence lays over the celestial moon known as Shima She is a patron goddess of Taxicost and is believed to be from a different Pantheon than those of standard deities of Solinia. Due to this, Zhuvirae is considered one of the &amp;lsquo;Outsiders&amp;rsquo; Zhuvirae shares many similar influence powers to the Somnus, God of Shadow and it is believed that she occupies his position in a different pantheon from either a different area of the universe or perhaps the multiverse Zhuvirae appears to have an influence over the Spirit Realm and is often spoken of in Shaman texts. The majority of her worshippers are beings that occupy the moon of Shima but there are other creatures on Solinia who she has contacted Her primary concern is the infiltration of the Solinian Plane of Shadow, a war which she has been engaging with against Somnus since her arrival She is directly opposed to all beings of Light and Sun, such as Sol&amp;rsquo;Azul and Auroris Some vampires worship her, but Mysmaal oppose all belief in her and follow Somnus exclusively due to the gift he gave them&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docs: Zurvan</title><link>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/gods/zurvan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/gods/zurvan/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;Zurvan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortals have been gifted the power of free will which often directly contradicts the divine will of the Gods. Due to this the Gods actions often only steer the direction of men. All of the Gods hold sway over areas of power and influence and all power flows downwards from the upper pantheon. The non discordant Gods primary desire is to maintain balance and offer stability to a reality which can only extend so far when coming into contact with beings who hold the power of free will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this it was necessary for a being which could foresee all potential realities laid bare by the manifested power of mortals so that each potential outcome of an event could be influenced in a direction to maintain a stable reality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing how such a power could benefit him the Dark God Etsi did take on the form of a beautiful female mortal named Eloria who&amp;rsquo;s glowing skin and figure was said to rival even the Goddess of Beauty, enamoured by this maidens form Bolaris the God of Knowledge did lay with her and she give birth to a child named Zurvan, blessed with the power of knowledge and wisdom and tutored by Etsi, Dark Lord of Bargains. As the divine child grew in age and power he began to foresee future events before they happened, whispering in the ears of his mother the outcomes of deals she would make. Etsi, in his ruse when bargaining with other Gods consolidated great power during this time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until the boy grew into a man that Etsis power over the child begin to falter. As his power grew he began to see not only events that would come but events that had or could have already happened. Seeing through his mother&amp;rsquo;s questions and their true purpose he would no longer aid her in acts of trickery, in a fit of rage Etsi cast the young man down from her plane onto Solinia never to return to the realms of the pantheon until he agreed to help her once more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alone and wondering the lands of men Zurvan came into contact with many mortals many who began to follow and worship him as a great prophet of fortune and foresight. Each contact with beings of free will took its toll on Zurvan as his powers of divination grew more complex and chaotic with each encounter. With so many potential realities and destinies of these mortal beings, Zurvans mind began to shatter, his language becoming ever more unintelligible and his writings become odd patterns and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zurvans ideas and stories became increasingly abstract and confusing (even his body appearing weakened as the burden of his gift appeared to take a toll on him physically) one of his most devout apostles began to write down the divine words into The Great Book of Destiny a task which drove each new scribe into an ever increasing madness. The task passed down from person to person as each apostle was slowly lost to the chaos in Zurvans teachings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the great suffering of his child Boralis cursed Etsi. Beseaching Boryan, The God of Dreams to place Zurvan in a peaceful sleep so that his physical body may rest as his mind grappled with the nature of time. It was there on the edges of the Plane of Dreams that the Plane of Time would sprout, it&amp;rsquo;s many paths spreading out into a complex maze of walkways along the sound of ticking clocks did Zurvan wander, occasionally passing great messages to his apostles on Solinia through the dreams of Goryan so the Great Book may continue to be written&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said the Great Book is still maintained by a secret order of paladins and shall one day find its way into the hands of a worthy mortal so it&amp;rsquo;s teachings can lead them through a time of great calamity&lt;/p&gt;
