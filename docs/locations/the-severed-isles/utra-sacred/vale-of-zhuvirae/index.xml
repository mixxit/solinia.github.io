&lt;p&gt;Avaris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Avaris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avaris is the only standing city of the darnar that did not fall to the undead plague that raged through Utra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avaris is a unique city on solinia in that it was constructed on the planes and shifted to this reality at the will of their creator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their arrival to Utra the Avarians became locked in a war with the Utran Dragon nest to the east&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also explored Utra and discovered the lost magic of the Oshira, they became particularly interested in the Oshiras use of teleportation magic, one which they tried to use to return back to their own plane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly all they could work out was to summon things to this reality which after experiment and experiment led to them eventually summoning their own God to this reality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep below Avaris is a massive sprawling complex of ruins belonging to some previous civilisation that existed on Utra, the Darnar keep many lost and forbidden things far below their city, memories of their wars with the dragons they would rather forget&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
