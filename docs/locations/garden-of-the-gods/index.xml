&lt;p&gt;The Anchor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The anchor is currently an overgrown tree mixed in with what looks like ancient technology It is protected by a sacred order who are xenophobic to outsiders Methabeht is here holding the past together The Anchor is an ancient device constructed over a gigantic circular hole which binds the past to the future It is believed the enormous hole was created during a massive collision with an asteroid or moon The Anchor was destroyed during the events of the Last War of the Gods During The Anchors destruction, Methabeht sacrificed himself to keep the chains of the past and present bonded together. An enormous Tree now sits over the site, its roots binding the broken chains of The Anchor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Inhabitants&lt;/strong&gt; Solinia - A female and last living descendent of the Dal The Great Tree - Living remains of Methabeht&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
