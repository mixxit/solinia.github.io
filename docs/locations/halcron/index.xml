&lt;div class=&#34;pageinfo pageinfo-primary&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsiyon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Tsiyon could be considered the world capital and home to many of the races of Solinia. It&amp;rsquo;s roots began as a small farming and fishing settlement on the southern edge of Halcron which really began it&amp;rsquo;s golden age following the arrival of the sea faring Vishim . Trading technology and some making their home in Tsiyon eventually led to significant world trade and exploration of the south western regions of Solinia. Before the arrival of the Vishim, the city itself was a lot smaller than today and without many of the districts. The original inhabitants which the Vishim first encountered are undoubtedly some form of descendent of Eusebians although they have never encountered their ancestors due to the difficulty in exploring the land of Alcor. The people of Halcron, who refer to their ancient selves as the Meroei, would always say they have inhabitted the lands and do not have any recorded history of ever leaving other continents of islands in search of new homes but infact their history stems from the times long before the modern era when their people fled underground to escape the cataclysm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demographics&#34;&gt;Demographics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsiyon is located on the continent of Halcron and has been a multi-cultural city for generations. Since there multiple races in Tsiyon, the cultures differ from locations in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;government&#34;&gt;Government&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City is ruled by the Meroei royalty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defences&#34;&gt;Defences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is surrounded by a series of ringed walls that protect the city from attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the south is the vast ocean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsiyon is seperated into many districts which serve a variety of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreign-quarter&#34;&gt;Foreign Quarter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign quarter lies on the eastern area of Tsiyon and serves as a gathering place for the public and outsiders and contains all the necessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one may expect from a capital such as Tsiyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign quarter also houses the great lighthouse on the southern city walls where the Wizard Guild makes their home constantly keeping the beacon alive with their elemental magic to aid the Vishim ships into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magnadome - Public battle grounds/arena&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weary Traveller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astute Transmute - Potion shop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants n&amp;rsquo; Chants - Herbs and reagents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwoods Goods - Misc goods shop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leather Endevor - Tannery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dusty Parchment - Scribee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Thread - Tailors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theatre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tempered Flame - Forge/Armoury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chizzled Boulder - Stonemasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mausaleum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aged Barrel - Brewery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arcane Athenaeum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temple of Golkara - A gigantic temple dedicated to the goddess of life and abundance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsiyon Central Bank - Central bank of Solinia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lighthouse - Wizard guild&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-district&#34;&gt;Military District&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military district is one of the older areas of Tsiyon and houses the previous Palace, Acropolis, which has now been converted into the headquarters for the Tsiyon Miiltary. Along side the old palace are many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-1&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for training infantry in melee combat as well as an offshoot of the Moracre Ranger Guild who spend their time teaching the art of archery. The Paladins also make their home here. In the center of the district lay fountains and trees which are occasionally used as a gathering area while the King of Tsiyon addresses his subject from the Old Palace battlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This district lies directly north of the Docks and due West of the Shared Housing District. It is also the location of the Northern Gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military district is also home to the Tsiyon Infirmary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the only way for outsiders to pass into the private racial areas and royal palace which lie to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acropolis is part of the original wall that surrounds the dock area and used to act as a gatehouse for the village. However since the major expansion of the city, new walls have been errected all around the new districts. Acropolis and the old city walls are a reminder to the Meroei of their past and the promise the royal bloodline made to keep their people safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-2&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acropolis - The Old Palace, a part of the old city walls that surround the dock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;palace-district&#34;&gt;Palace District&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern palace district lays to the south of the Noble District and is on the western side of the city neighbouring the Vishim district. Originally the palace, Acropolis, was housed in the military district but the royalty moved due to extensive traffic from trade relationships with other races on Solinia. Acropolis is now used by the Military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new palace houses the current the royal bloodline of the Meroei and the King of Tsiyon and overlooks the cliffs to the south of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-3&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vishim-district&#34;&gt;Vishim District&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vishim district is considered one of wonders of the city. Over the years the vishim have converted this district into a forest in honour of the gods they worship and where they make their home in the houses they have built amongst the trees and lake here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-4&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lidkim-district&#34;&gt;Lidkim District&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lidkim district lies on the northern wall and is the first housing area to the west of the military district. Here the Lidkim make their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-5&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player Housing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidkim Embassy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;endol-district&#34;&gt;Endol District&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shared-housing-district&#34;&gt;Shared Housing District&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shared housing district is directly to the north of the Foreign Quarter and houses the citizens of Tsiyon who enjoy living among all races rather than just their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsiders hoping to visit other districts than the Foreign Quarter must pass through here and into the Military district before being able to make it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those hoping to make their livelyhood from outsiders will usually make their home here, being close to their businesses in the Foreign Quarter gives them a short distance to travel and excellent opportunities for networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;facilities-9&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docks&#34;&gt;Docks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docks are built upon the oldest areas of the city and are a common entrance point for outsiders as well as goods from all over Solinia. Many ships can be found in this extremely large district including ones still being constructed by Vishim Shipwrights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passengers arriving in the docks must travel from here to the Military District to enter the private racial homes in Tsiyon which lie to the west or the Shared Housing and Foreign Quarter to the East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docks are still surrounded by the original walls that have protected Old Tsiyon for so long and the only way to leave the dock area is through the Acropolis underpass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsiyon was the location of birth of the global currency. Due to the expense in dealing with individual race currencies a central bank was created by the mixed races of Tsiyon to ease the expense and delay it held on trade. Since the creation of this currency most cultures have benefited from prosperity and see it as one of the benefits of racial diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
