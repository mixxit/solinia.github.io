&lt;p&gt;Isle of Olendor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The home of the Keepers of the Eternal in The Elezuan Deep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Island holds an ancient monastry that is dedicated to the worship of Zurvan. It is here that the Keepers pen the ancient text of Zurvan. Most of its members either become distant, catatonic or insane after spending some time writing the sacred words and so the Island is a secret among the general population of solinia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keepers are hostile to any newcomers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the divine nature of the work of the island inhabitants, it has been said that time passes far differently than the outside world. A day on the island could be a hundred years in the rest of solinia&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
