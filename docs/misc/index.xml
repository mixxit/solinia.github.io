&lt;p&gt;Old Item Lore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Old Item Lore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tend to your dead when the battle is done if you tend to the wounded til the battle is won&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjuring fire was one of the first abilities taught to the magicians of Tsiyon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swear to you, Lord Methabeht, smite my enemy and I shall forever give myself in service. - Darakua&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old elemental school page detailing the art of summoning perfect circles of frost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dusty parchment documents the history of the Mysmaal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting a winged beast is easier done when they are young - Elarok Lightbringer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Modern Humans seem to be just as obsessed with knowledge as their predecessors - Salvador Kondrat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warrior&amp;rsquo;s stamina reserves are invaluable in the heat of battle Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward my brothers! We shall win the day! General Mato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a cloud of blood, the warrior seeks h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that bow, call from the sky for arrows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe my brothers, the gift of the gods!- Ioni Miriad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no haste when traveling this land, move quickly to your destination. Sepa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who needs air when Methabeht will provide? Ioni Miriad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to my children, I leave this cloth. As shelter and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good look hitting me! Bleed of the Cell Squad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle was fierce and lasted weeks, the O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shot through the dark pines hungry for their next meal, in a pack as one. Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arcane Shield is passed down since the time of the Vishim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lizardmen have always had the ability to take a few more hits when the going gets tough General Mato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient curse of Deuzulus, passed down for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beings of the element can survive in places others could never Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of &amp;lsquo;Blinking&amp;rsquo; is taught to High Human children at an early age. Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Halfling race has always been a hard one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ogre&amp;rsquo;s can use their sheer mass to great effect in combat Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trolls have an innate ability to summon bursts of furious strength Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple piece of technology developed by the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various diseases carried by the undead&amp;rsquo;s rotten flesh are often turned on their enemies. Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge of a Barbarian is a sight to behold Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are coming for us brothers! We shall make them rue the day! General Mato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient mechanical weapon of the clockworks is legend Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bleeding foe will fall with ease Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To block an attack is the first step, it only becomes useful if you can retaliate Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spell seems to have storm runes on it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw upon the power of the under dark to swee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There lay in front of them their beloved rule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like minded elves find comfort in their share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You draw upon the legacy of your people to ai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foresworn&amp;rsquo;s blessing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forsaken turn their ancient curse against&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Clockworks have springed heels, allowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The races of the combine agreed upon a sacred&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes not aiming for one target is exactly what you need Captain Bynde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shoot a foe is easy, to hit them in such a way that you remain hidden, now that is a skill! Rauchlehre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash is the staple of many Tsiyonian Magician&amp;rsquo;s arsenals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well timed dash can confuse and disorient your opponent, leaving them open to an attack Rauchlehre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those goblins can disappear at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice, be on your guard men! Rauchlehre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not the most powerful spell, Magic Missile is a standard spell that every aspiring young mage must know. -Scholar Aquilar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel the breath of Methabeht upon you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magicians of Tsiyon are renown for their ability to create storms of flames&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look upwards my son, see what methabeht can bring for us - Druid Kenria Selri&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through worship we can call upon aid in our times of need - Ioni Miriad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold! The gods look favourably upon you! - Ioni Miriad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dead dare not speak of what lays within that ancient ring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilandria clammered up the ancient steps of that forgotten temple - the Tinai were real!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shamans of old could bring the spirits to bear witness against the living&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goblin shamans were the foremost in curse-mongering spirits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once used by the Machelite Wizards for aid with thier footings on the passes of thier mountain home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that halflings tend to hide their armour under their clothes, leaving their opponent unsure how well armoured they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Half Elves seem to have taken the most beneficial traits of the Elves and Humans to make them into skilled runners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked deep into his eyes and he looked deep into me, into my very essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With wings outstretched they took to the sky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pah, you call that magic! - Last words of Kliri Xeria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch your step about fairy rings. Lest you find that somethings queer. Once you were there and now your here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh Manandu! Spare my people from this wretched disease!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methabeht, I beseech thee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to get that looked at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! Ashtor stands with me this day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can do better than that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The God of the Hunt blessed this arrow herself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT DID YOU SAY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat my friends! Eat, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastering the art of sorcery against one target is all well and good, but what about when you are surrounded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had lost his mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come forth to me brethren!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off we go then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only those that could withstand the flames could converse with the lord of fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guardian must be unwavering when facing an enemy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-silence-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will never forget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instant death with only one shot - of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send your dogs, do your worst! We have a cause to fight for and we will never give in to the likes of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rangers of Asgarad were known for their prayers to Methabeht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how it is possible to take the power of Ice Comet and turn it into many?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your blades will do nothing against that mad mage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the creatures of the wild fear them, for they stand at the very top of the food chain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 years he&amp;rsquo;s conquered that arena - i don&amp;rsquo;t see him giving it up any time soon - Joaira Ragepaw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The God of the Hunt directly influences the Ranger as they run faster for a short period of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Ranger becomes more adept, they can use their own stamina pools to rush in or out of danger for a time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ranger learns to master their own body, and can force themselves to run at abnormal speeds to better hunt their prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You give into the primal instinct of your prey and use their own speed to hunt them in the wild&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful! Don&amp;rsquo;t play with fire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot in here? Or is it just me..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you smoke? Not anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You feel a sense of dread when looking at this corrupted armour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kura repurposed that ancient arena into a place of death and blood - Gerla NVar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mysmaal demand blood to sustain themselves, but all they had were Orcs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahora_Mirleaf Back before we came here there was a forest, it was a peaceful place in the day, but then people started dissapearing in the night. We&amp;rsquo;d hear horrible howls and occasionally the screams of our neighbours. One by one our villagers dissapeared and when it &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melaron_the_Lich The serpent hisses with the purest of rage. Harnessing its power it rips apart the realm of the Gods. You stand before a relic of history which has been claimed by lesser beings but its power sits, ever dormant, waiting for the return of she which ravages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melaron_the_Lich The appropriated realm of the Ravager has been claimed by one of Hate. The Goddess howls atop her tower of frenzy, restless she eyes further conquest to satisfy her endless lust of power. Bring me one of her children and I will bestow you with her glory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melaron_the_Lich You please the Goddess with your offerings. Bring me a weapon of compassion so we may taint it with her fury&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farin_N&amp;rsquo;Rix So you finally got around to making some money here huh? Well that&amp;rsquo;s great! Here&amp;rsquo;s your drink, hope it was worth the labour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariala_D&amp;rsquo;Raal Oh hey handsome! You here for a song? My throat is a little dry but I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting the next song soon, hope you can be around for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariala_D&amp;rsquo;Raal For me? How kind, I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m rather nervous on my first night here. Father didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate me turning my back on my studies at V&amp;rsquo;lorn for a career as a bard but I fear I could not spend one more day scouring through those boring dusty tomes. He a&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariala_D&amp;rsquo;Raal You have a way of getting revenge? Do go on? His battle plans? I suppose I could retreave them for you, he does so hate it when his plans fall apart. It will take some sneaking around, i shall use one of my stage characters, Licil_R&amp;rsquo;Sath, meet me outside&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raan_N&amp;rsquo;Var The tomes of the underdark have been studiously kept by our keepers for centuries. Here we propel our people forward by the wisdom and teachings of our forebearers. It is no doubt that the knowledge that sits within these walls is what positioned the dar&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raan_N&amp;rsquo;Var There is always work to be completed. Currently I am sequested to a job that could be fulfilled by one of my servants, and seeing as you are here perhaps you could run this errand for me. Scurry along with this tome for High Priest Xeran will you and I s&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raan_N&amp;rsquo;Var As much as I appreciate the efforts of the priesthood, I care little for that aged priests gratitude. My role here is to provide knowledge and for that I need no thanks. You have proven yourself a useful little rat, I will now offload some more of my bur&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HighPriestXeran Another lost misguided soul steps into the bosom of hatred. Deuzulus has brought you today, he sets you on a path to emblazon you with eternal scorn. Hatred for others protects us and empowers us. It is with this strife we have conquered The Under and sh&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HighPriestXeran Can it be? Such an archaic tome I thought had been lost! Raans service will be noted to the Priesthood, please send our gratitude. We shall implement its teaching into the doctrine immediately&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HighPriestXeran The endless work of spreading the message of Deuzulus is a task for each one of us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord_D&amp;rsquo;Raal The S&amp;rsquo;Kor fool pushes his religious agenda upon the citizens of Undergate damning the security and future of the city. His efforts must be put to an end if we do not want to fall into absolute chaos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord_D&amp;rsquo;Raal Lord S&amp;rsquo;Kor has a continuous stream of resources from the fanatical devotees that believe in his madness of discovering the birthplace of Deuzulus. If we can sow doubt into the populous about this foolhardy venture of his we can reduce his finances and tu&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord_D&amp;rsquo;Raal The artifact which mentions the origins of Deuzulus is currently locked up in his vault and guarded heavily. If the artifact were to say, disappear, he would have nothing to present to the believers at the announcement this evening. Obviously stealing fr&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord_S&amp;rsquo;Kor It is the divine will of Deuzulus that has guided us since our inception in that fetid nest of mysmaal and it is his will that will lead us forth. Abandoning the search for the birthplace of Deuzulus for some idiotic campaign to the surface will only det&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len The Indigo Daggers are masters of stealth, forgery and deception. Any job can be satisfied if your pockets are deep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len If you are looking for a forgery please be prepared to pay a hefty cost, of course there are alternatives to payment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len Services for services. It so happens we have a task that may suit you, if you are discreet and can put aside your moral obligations for a moment. Does that sound like something that could interest you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len Good, then what is it you want to be forged specifically? Deeds, official documents, or the change of duty pages for House S&amp;rsquo;Kor? Don&amp;rsquo;t look shocked, we have people in many places. Understand this, we know that you are working for House D&amp;rsquo;Raal and it wou&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len Lord D&amp;rsquo;Raal is currently financing the army of Undergate and is planning an attack on one of the local surface settlements. Normally we dark elves don&amp;rsquo;t concern ourselves with the lives of lesser beings but in this case we have a specific interest the co&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len I shall provide you with what you need on receipt of a simple slip of paper. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re quite capable of that yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melin_R&amp;rsquo;Len Good, I see you are capable of manipulation and able to follow orders. I may have more work for you in the future. For now, we shall conclude our deal. This document should get you what you need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licil_R&amp;rsquo;Sath Oh look, a walking lump of refuse, how novel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licil_R&amp;rsquo;Sath Move quickly, I fear he is suspicious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard_N&amp;rsquo;Rot As members of the personal guard of Lord S&amp;rsquo;Kor it is our duty to protect the S&amp;rsquo;Kor dynasty and its property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard_N&amp;rsquo;Rot Oh? I was expecting G&amp;rsquo;Tir to relieve me and you are not him. If there has been a change of duty, then where are your change of duty pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard_N&amp;rsquo;Rot So I am to personally escort Lord S&amp;rsquo;Kor on his announcement, very well. Take the relic and protect it like your own. Should anything happen to it Lord S&amp;rsquo;Kor will have you quartered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamrin_N&amp;rsquo;Rot Welcome to the Blue Flame, we specialise in dark elven armour, weaponry and tools. Do you have something specific in mind or are you just browsing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamrin_N&amp;rsquo;Rot It just so happens there is something I need. I have an order to fulfill that requires a particular type of reagent for imbueing a dagger. It may not be an easy task, but if you can provide me with the blood of a night creature, I can reward you with an &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamrin_N&amp;rsquo;Rot Wonderful, and from the looks, completely uncontaminated. This should satisfy the order perfectly. Thank you for your aid, here&amp;rsquo;s your coin as promised&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docs: Old Passives</title><link>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/misc/old-passives/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/misc/old-passives/</guid><description>
